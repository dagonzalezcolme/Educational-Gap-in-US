## Question 1 Visual Design

### Audience and Goals

The audience includes students and policymakers interested in global education. The goal is for them to quickly see where the biggest gender gaps are and understand the surprising pattern where females often finish school more often in developed countries. The design was influenced by the need to reveal information slowly, moving from the big picture to the specific details.

### Story Narrative

The story flows in four parts:
- Global Overview: The map shows the whole world first, letting people see which regions have big gaps.
- Top 20 Dumbbell: The first chart focuses on the worst gaps, which reveals the unexpected 50% completion pattern.
- Pattern Investigation: Two separate dumbbell charts are then used to prove the 50% pattern is real across all countries.
- Summary

The visual hierarchy makes sure viewers see the most important parts. The colors highlight extreme gaps, and lines on the charts show the size of the gap between genders.

### Design Choices

#### Chart Encoding

- Choropleth: A map was used because seeing the gaps grouped by geography (like Africa) is important for showing regional patterns.
- Dumbbell Chart: This chart is useful because the connecting line immediately shows the size of the gap between male and female rates. Also allows users to quickly compare gap sizes with other countries.
- Splitting by 50%: This decision reduced the clutter on the charts and made the main finding easier to compare.

#### Design Principles

- Cognitive Load: The step by step structure keeps viewers from being overwhelmed.

### Reflection

- The way the story was structured and the discovery of the 50% pattern worked very well.
- Main concerns were the 50% threshold, because it is just an arbitrary line, and dealing with missing data on the world map.
- If there was more time, adding interactivity would be very helpful.
